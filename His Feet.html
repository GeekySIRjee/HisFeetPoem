    <h2>District <em> Elder M.L. Maughmer, Jr.</em></h2>
<pre>
     His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That made His little face glow
    When His mother tickled His tiny toes.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    Which at the age of twelve
    Made Him stand before those educated well.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That stepped into the Jordan River
    And carried our souls deliverer.</pre>

<pre>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That stood atop a mountain high
    And proclaimed the Kingdom of Heaven is nigh.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That treaded across countless miles
    Bringing hope, healing, happiness, and smiles.
   </pre>

<pre>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That travelled over sand, rocks, and dirt
    Carrying comfort and love to all those who hurt.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That gently bent a blade of grass
    Are the very feet that bore the guilt of my past.
   </pre>

   <pre>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That didn’t run when His accusers approached
    But held fast His stand in spite of every stroke.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That marched up Golgotha’s hill
    Fulfilling God’s purpose and His will.
   </pre>

   
   <pre>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That were nailed to the cross
    Just so I would not be lost.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    Stepped over into captivity
    And lead the broken captives free.
   </pre>

   <pre>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That walked out of a borrowed tomb
    And through locked doors of an upper room.
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet
    That crushed the curse of sin,
    Will one day step on earth again,
    To judge all history
    And forever reign in victory.
    Oh, to sit at His feet,
    Yes, those beautiful feet”
    Is where I want to be
    Worshipping God for all eternity.
   </pre>
