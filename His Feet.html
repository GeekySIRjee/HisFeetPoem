<h1>His Feet
    District Elder M.L. Maughmer, Jr.</h1>
<p>
     His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That made His little face glow<br>
    When His mother tickled His tiny toes.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    Which at the age of twelve<br>
    Made Him stand before those educated well.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That stepped into the Jordan River<br>
    And carried our souls deliverer.<br></p>

<p>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That stood atop a mountain high<br>
    And proclaimed the Kingdom of Heaven is nigh.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That treaded across countless miles<br>
    Bringing hope, healing, happiness, and smiles.<br>
   </p>

<p>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That travelled over sand, rocks, and dirt<br>
    Carrying comfort and love to all those who hurt.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That gently bent a blade of grass<br>
    Are the very feet that bore the guilt of my past.<br>
   </p>

   <p>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That didn’t run when His accusers approached<br>
    But held fast His stand in spite of every stroke.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That marched up Golgotha’s hill<br>
    Fulfilling God’s purpose and His will.<br>
   </p>

   
   <p>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That were nailed to the cross<br>
    Just so I would not be lost.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    Stepped over into captivity<br>
    And lead the broken captives free.<br>
   </p>

   <p>His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That walked out of a borrowed tomb<br>
    And through locked doors of an upper room.<br>
    His feet, oh, those beautiful feet<br>
    That crushed the curse of sin,<br>
    Will one day step on earth again,<br>
    To judge all history,<br>
    And forever reign in victory.<br>
    Oh, to sit at His feet,<br>
    Yes, those beautiful feet”<br>
    Is where I want to be<br>
    Worshipping God for all eternity.<br>
   </p>
